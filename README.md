## Project Overview
**Data Analysis Project Using Python** is a collection of end-to-end data analysis notebooks that demonstrate practical workflows for cleaning, exploring, and visualizing real-world datasets. The repository contains multiple domain-focused analyses — from retail and e-commerce to healthcare and classic datasets — each designed to highlight actionable insights and reproducible methods. 

---

## Why this repository is valuable for clients
- **Business-ready insights**: Each notebook shows how to turn raw data into clear business questions, analyses, and recommendations.
- **Reproducible workflow**: Demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and basic statistical interpretation.
- **Easy to adapt**: Code patterns are modular and simple to extend to your own datasets.
- **Clear deliverables**: Visualizations, summary tables, and written insights that can be used in reports or presentations.

## Projects included
- **Coffee Sales Project** — Sales trends, seasonality, and visual storytelling using `Coffe_sales.csv` and `Coffee_Sales_Project (2).ipynb`.  
- **Healthcare (Stroke Data) Project** — Data cleaning and EDA on health & stroke dataset (`healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv`) to surface risk patterns.  
- **Titanic Project** — Classic survival analysis with feature exploration to understand survival drivers (`Titanic Project.ipynb`, `Titanic-Dataset.xls`).  
- **Sample Superstore / Amazon / Ecommerce Notebooks** — Example retail/e-commerce analyses demonstrating customer segmentation, sales performance, and product insights.  
(Full file list and notebooks are in the repository root).

## Key features & methods demonstrated
- Data ingestion from CSV/XLS files
- Data cleaning: missing values, type conversions, basic feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics, group-by analyses
- Visual storytelling: line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, distribution plots (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Business interpretation: translating charts into actionable insights and recommendations
- Notebook-style documentation so clients can follow the analysis step-by-step
