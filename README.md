# Data Analysis Project Using Python

## Introduction

This repository contains several data-analysis projects implemented in Python. The aim is to explore, clean, and visualize real-world datasets on disparate themes (e.g. sales data, health data, Titanic) to derive insights and demonstrate data-analysis workflows using libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## Projects Included

| Notebook / Dataset | Description / Notes |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| `Coffee_Sales_Project (2).ipynb` + `Coffe_sales.csv` | Analysis of coffee sales data (cleaning, visualization, trends) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} |
| `Healthcare_Project (1).ipynb` + `healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv` | Health-/stroke-related dataset: data cleaning, EDA, insights. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} |
| `Titanic Project.ipynb` + `Titanic-Dataset.xls` | Classic Titanic dataset analysis: survival patterns, statistics, visualization. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} |

You can extend the repository with additional datasets / notebooks for other analyses as needed.

## Getting Started / Dependencies

To work with these notebooks and run the analyses locally, you will need:

- Python 3.x installed  
- A Jupyter notebook environment (Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab)  
- Python libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and optionally other common data-analysis libraries (e.g. `numpy`) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

You can install dependencies (e.g. via pip):

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
